3. List all the invertible elements in $\Z_{26}$ and determine their inverses.
<br>

4. Prove that $a \bmod{n} = b \bmod{n}$ if and only if $a \equiv b \pmod{n}$.
<br>

5. If an encryption function $E_k$ is identical to the decryption function $D_k$, then the key $k$ is said to be an *involutory key*. Find all involutory keys for the Caesar cipher over $\Z_{26}$.
<br>

6. An affine cipher has $E_k(x) = 5x+1 \bmod{26}$ as its encryption function. What is its decryption function?
<br>

7. Suppose that $k = (a, b)$ is a key for the affine cipher over $\Z_n$. Prove that $k$ is involutory if and only if $a^{-1} \bmod{n} = a$ and $b(a+1) \equiv 0 \pmod{n}$.
