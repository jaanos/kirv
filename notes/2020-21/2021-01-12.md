## Elliptic curves

### Exercise 1

Does the elliptic curve equation $y^2 = x^3 + 10x + 5$ define a group over ${\mathbb{Z}_{17}}$?

---

### Exercise 2

Find all points on the elliptic curve $y^2 = x^3 + x + 6$ over ${\mathbb{Z}_{11}}$.

---

### Exercise 3

Let $P = (8, 3)$ and $Q = (3, 6)$ be points on the elliptic curve
$y^2 = x^3 + x + 6$ over ${\mathbb{Z}_{11}}$. Compute $P + Q$ and $5P$.

---

### Exercise 4

Let $P = (2, 4)$ be a generator of order $n = 13$ of the group on the elliptic curve $y^2 = x^3 + x + 6$ over <i>$\mathbb{Z}{_{11}}$</i>.
The Simplified ECIES has <i>$\mathbb{Z}{_{11}^{*}}$</i> as its plaintext space. Suppose that the private key is $d = 3$.

1. Compute the public key $Q = dP$.
2. Encrypt the plaintext $m = 7$ and then decrypt the obtained ciphertext. Use the random value $k = 4$.

---

### Exercise 5

We will show how computing a multiple of a point on an elliptic curve can be sped up.

1. Show that subtraction over elliptic curves has the same complexity as addition.

2. Show that any integer $n$ can be written as

   $$
   n = \sum_{i=0}^{\ell-1} c_i 2^i ,
   $$

   where for all $i$, ${c_i} \in \lbrace -1, 0, 1 \rbrace$, and ${c_i} \ne 0$ implies ${c_{i+1}} = 0$. How many bits do we need to store a number in this format?

3. Show how computing a multiple of a point on an elliptic curve can be done using the format above. What is the expected speedup?
