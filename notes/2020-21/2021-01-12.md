## Elliptic curves

## Groups on elliptic curves over prime fields

* General form: $E : y^2 \equiv x^3 + ax + b \pmod{p}$, $p$ prime, $4a^3 + 27b^2 \ne 0$
* $E = \lbrace (x, y) \mid y^2 \equiv x^3 + ax + b \pmod{p} \rbrace \cup \lbrace \mathcal{O} \rbrace$
* For $P = ({P_x}, {P_y}), Q = ({Q_x}, {Q_y}) \in E$:
  - $-P = ({P_x}, -{P_y})$
  - $P + \mathcal{O} = \mathcal{O} + P = P$
  - $P + (-P) = \mathcal{O}$
  - $P + Q = R = ({R_x}, {R_y})$, where
    + if $P \ne Q$, then $\lambda = { {P_y} - {Q_y} \over {P_x} - {Q_x}}$
    + if $P = Q$, then $\lambda = {3 {P_x^2} + a \over 2 {P_y}}$
    + ${R_x} = \lambda^2 - {P_x} - {Q_x}$
    + ${R_y} = \lambda ({P_x} - {R_x}) - {P_y}$


### Simplified ECIES

* **Domain parameters**:
  - elliptic curve $E : y^2 \equiv x^3 + ax + b \pmod{p}$, where $p$ is prime
  - group generator $P$ of prime order $n$ (i.e., $E = \langle P \rangle = \lbrace kP \mid 0 \le k \le n-1 \rbrace$)
* **Key generation**:
  - private key $d \stackrel{R}{\in} {\mathbb{Z}_n^{*}}$
  - public key $Q = dP$
* **Encryption** of $m \in {\mathbb{Z}_n^{*}}$:
  - choose $r \stackrel{R}{\in} {\mathbb{Z}_n^{*}}$
  - compute $R = rP$
  - compute $S = rQ = ({S_x}, {S_y}) \ne \mathcal{O}$
  - output $c = (R, m {S_x})$
* **Decryption** of $c = (R, x) \in E \times {\mathbb{Z}_n^{*}}$:
  - compute $S = dR = ({S_x}, {S_y}) \ne \mathcal{O}$
  - output $m = x {S_x^{-1}}$

### Exercise 1

Does the elliptic curve equation $y^2 = x^3 + 10x + 5$ define a group over ${\mathbb{Z}_{17}}$?

---

### Exercise 2

Find all points on the elliptic curve $y^2 = x^3 + x + 6$ over ${\mathbb{Z}_{11}}$.

---

### Exercise 3

Let $P = (8, 3)$ and $Q = (3, 6)$ be points on the elliptic curve
$y^2 = x^3 + x + 6$ over ${\mathbb{Z}_{11}}$. Compute $P + Q$ and $5P$.

---

### Exercise 4

Let $P = (2, 4)$ be a generator of order $n = 13$ of the group on the elliptic curve $y^2 = x^3 + x + 6$ over <i>$\mathbb{Z}{_{11}}$</i>.
The Simplified ECIES has <i>$\mathbb{Z}{_{11}^{*}}$</i> as its plaintext space. Suppose that the private key is $d = 3$.

1. Compute the public key $Q = dP$.
2. Encrypt the plaintext $m = 7$ and then decrypt the obtained ciphertext. Use the random value $k = 4$.

---

### Exercise 5

We will show how computing a multiple of a point on an elliptic curve can be sped up.

1. Show that subtraction over elliptic curves has the same complexity as addition.

2. Show that any integer $n$ can be written as

   $$
   n = \sum_{i=0}^{\ell-1} c_i 2^i ,
   $$

   where for all $i$, ${c_i} \in \lbrace -1, 0, 1 \rbrace$, and ${c_i} \ne 0$ implies ${c_{i+1}} = 0$. How many bits do we need to store a number in this format?

3. Show how computing a multiple of a point on an elliptic curve can be done using the format above. What is the expected speedup?
