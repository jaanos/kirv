## Cryptanalysis of classical ciphers

### Exercise 1

One reasonable idea for enhancing the security of a cryptosystem is to use double encryption. Is double encryption with the Hill cipher any safer than simple encryption? Justify your answer.

### Exercise 2

Encrypt the message *LJUBLJANA* using the Vigenère cipher with the key *FRI*. Compute the [index of coincidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_of_coincidence) of the obtained ciphertext.

---

### Exercise 3

The following ciphertext has been encrypted with the Vigenère cipher. Find the possible key lengths with the Kasiski test. Word divisions have not been preserved.
